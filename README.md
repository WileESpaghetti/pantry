# Pantry

I love using [Larder](https://larder.io) for storing bookmarks, but there is a couple of features
that I really want in the service. New development require a sufficient number of votes before they can be considered
for addition. With Pantry as a frontend to the service, I can modify bookmarks however I like before sending them to
Larder, or implement features that might be too niche for most users.
